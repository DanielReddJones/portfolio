        I am an IT guy that loves programming! I enjoy making games, terminal-based applications, and web development!

        <center><h2>About Me</h2></center>
        I am currently working as a Systems Analyst at LeTourneau University, but I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skillset. 
        In the future, I hope to either be a Linux Systems Administrator, or a software engineer. Those are two wildly different positions, but those are where my passions lie. Linux is my favorite operating system and I would like to make working with it my job. 
        Barring that, I want to focus on programming and making tools that make the world a better place.
